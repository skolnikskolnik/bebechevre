## Description: 
This project is NOT about baby goats, despite its name. This project helps save users time by generating a README file using a script. Users are then free to add or remove anything from their file in order to customize it to their needs and/or wants. This is ideal for any developer who wants to share what they are working on.

Here is a [link](https://youtu.be/8It383aUTiY) to a youtube video of the working product.
